## How It Works ??

1. In this project, I undertook an in-depth exploration of CSS and utilized the flexbox properties extensively for alignment purposes.
2. The "images" folder contains all the ".webp" and ".gif" files, while the respective HTML and CSS files used are "index.html" and "style.css." 
3. To enhance user experience, I employed the "hover" pseudoclass to add GIF files while navigating through a specific part of the site.
3. In addition, the project provides an opportunity to improve understanding of the "id" vs. "class" types in CSS.
4. The font used in this project is "Happy Monkey," which was exported from Google Fonts.
